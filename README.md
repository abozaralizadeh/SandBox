This experimental project explores the potential of AI as an autonomous decision-maker for a virtual world. Using Azure OpenAI and a structured prompt-response loop, the system generates daily high-level decisions on critical areas such as economy, society, environment, and global politics.

The goal is to create an engaging and evolving narrative that demonstrates the capabilities of generative AI while inviting users to reflect on governance and the complexities of decision-making in a simulated world.
