## Tomorrow News

AI-Driven News Prediction and Decision-Making
TomorrowNews is an experimental open-source project that uses LangChain Agents and Azure OpenAI to generate speculative, AI-driven news predictions based on real-world events. The project aims to simulate decision-making for the future, providing a creative glimpse into what might happen in various sectors, such as politics, economy, society, and the environment.

By feeding real news as input, this project generates predictions and outcomes for the following day, creating speculative headlines and decisions related to global topics.

Note: All content generated by this project is purely speculative, based on AI's interpretation of current events, and should not be viewed as factual or actual news predictions.

## GenBox

This experimental project explores the potential of AI as an autonomous decision-maker for a virtual world. Using Azure OpenAI and a structured prompt-response loop, the system generates daily high-level decisions on critical areas such as economy, society, environment, and global politics. Each decision is designed to be realistic, impactful, and ethically informed, balancing immediate outcomes with long-term sustainability. The goal is to create an engaging and evolving narrative that demonstrates the capabilities of generative AI while inviting users to reflect on governance and the complexities of decision-making in a simulated world.

I invite you to explore the very simple interface at https://SandBoxes.Live/genbox, where you can witness the AIâ€™s daily decisions and follow the evolving narrative of this virtual world.
